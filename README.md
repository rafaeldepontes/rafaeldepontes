I'm [Rafael Carneiro](https://linkedin.com/in/rafael-cr-carneiro), a backend software engineer in Brazil.

I usually build whatever comes to mind.

If you have any interesting ideas we could develop together, please get in touch.

My main stack is `Go`, `Java`, and `C#`, but I can also work around with `React`, `TypeScript` and `Python`.

Most of my pinned projects are things I've been studying recently, so feel free to check out what I'm currently working on.
